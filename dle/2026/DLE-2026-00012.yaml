schema_version: 1.0
bypass_description: >
  The detection identifies wget downloads into temporary directories by matching
  the process image string ending in "/wget". An attacker can clone or rename the
  wget binary and execute it under a different filename, preserving identical
  download behavior while altering the logged process name, causing the detection
  condition to fail and the download to proceed without alerting.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes the process image name is a stable and trustworthy
  identifier for wget execution and that attackers cannot clone or rename the
  binary prior to performing the in-scope download activity.

  product: linux
  category: file
complexity: Low
notes: >
  This bypass is trivial for both privileged and unprivileged attackers, as wget
  binaries can be copied to writable directories without changing functionality.
  The rule reflects threat-specific intelligence that does not generalize well to
  adversarial environments where process names are attacker-controlled.
