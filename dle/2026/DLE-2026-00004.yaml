bypass_description: >
  The detection monitors a limited set of RDS-specific CloudTrail event names
  associated with EC2-Classic DB security groups. By modifying RDS instances
  using alternative RDS APIs such as ModifyDBInstance, restoring databases from
  snapshots, or changing network exposure via EC2 VPC security group APIs, an
  attacker can perform equivalent or more impactful configuration changes
  without generating the expected event names, causing the detection to fail.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that security-relevant RDS configuration changes will
  be performed using a small, fixed set of RDS DB security group APIs and that
  these APIs remain consistent across deployment models and service versions.

notes: >
  The rule reflects EC2-Classic RDS security group behavior and does not account
  for EC2 VPC-based RDS deployments, alternative RDS modification APIs, snapshot
  restoration workflows, or related EC2 security group changes. A more robust
  approach would correlate RDS configuration state changes, EC2 security group
  modifications, and public accessibility flags across deployment models.
