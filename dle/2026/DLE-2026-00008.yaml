bypass_description: >
  The detection excludes BITS file rename events where the filename length exceeds
  30 characters to suppress legitimate third-party software noise. An attacker can
  deliberately use a long filename to match this excluded baseline, causing the
  negated length condition to evaluate to false and bypass the remaining detection
  logic entirely.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes malicious BITS transfers will use short filenames and that
  long filenames are a reliable proxy for benign third-party software behavior.
  It further assumes attackers cannot intentionally align with this baseline.

  This bypass is deterministic and requires no prior context or environmental
  preconditioning. The same rule is also vulnerable to omitted file types and
  additional gate inversion paths, allowing multiple independent evasion strategies.
