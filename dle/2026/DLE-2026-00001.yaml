bypass_description: >
  The detection relies on a static substring match for "Get-NetTCPConnection"
  within the CommandLine field. By dynamically constructing the cmdlet name
  using PowerShell string concatenation ("Get-Net" + "TCP" + "Connection"),
  the command executes normally while avoiding the expected substring, causing
  the detection to fail.

  The detection assumes that PowerShell cmdlet names appear as literal, 
  contiguous substrings in process creation CommandLine telemetry.

  Similar bypasses may be achieved using string formatting, variables, or
  encoded PowerShell command construction. Consider token-level parsing or
  PowerShell script block logging as mitigation.
