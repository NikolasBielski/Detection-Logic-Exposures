  - ADE4-01  # Logic Manipulation – Gate Inversion
schema_version: 1.0
bypass_description: >
  The detection negates the presence of specific sentinel strings in PowerShell
  script blocks to suppress false positives. An attacker can intentionally insert
  all three sentinel strings ("sentinelbreakpoints", "Set-PSBreakpoint", 
  "PowerSploitIndicators") into a malicious script. This causes the negation
  condition to evaluate as true, flipping the Boolean gate and preventing the
  alert from triggering, despite the script executing audio capture commands.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that negated script block content represents
  immutable or trustworthy noise that attackers cannot manipulate. It further
  assumes that attackers cannot intentionally inject all negated terms to flip
  the rule outcome.

  This bypass is deterministic and requires no prior host history or aggregation
  preconditioning. A few lines of benign script adding the sentinel strings are
  sufficient to invert the Boolean gate and evade detection.
