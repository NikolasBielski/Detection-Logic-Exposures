schema_version: 1.0
bypass_description: >
  The detection correlates process execution and subsequent network activity by
  matching on process.name equal to "cat" across both stages of a sequence rule.
  By cloning or renaming the cat binary and executing it under a different filename,
  the attacker preserves identical behavior while altering the logged process name,
  causing both sequence states to fail and the detection to be bypassed.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that process.name is a reliable and immutable identifier
  for the executed binary and that attackers cannot influence it by cloning or
  renaming utilities prior to execution.

notes: >
  This bypass is deterministic and requires no elevated privileges, as standard
  users can copy binaries to writable directories. Because both states of the
  sequence depend on string-based process identification, a single rename causes
  the entire sequence to fail. Incorporating executable path, file hash, or code
  signature checks would reduce exposure.
