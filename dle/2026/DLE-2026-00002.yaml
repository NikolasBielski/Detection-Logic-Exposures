bypass_description: >
  The detection relies on static substring matches for "Net.WebClient",
  ".DownloadString(", and ".DownloadFile(" within PowerShell script block
  telemetry. By dynamically constructing method names, using variables,
  or invoking download methods via reflection, the download functionality
  executes successfully while avoiding the expected substrings, causing
  the detection condition to evaluate as false.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that dangerous .NET method invocations will appear
  as literal, contiguous substrings in PowerShell script block telemetry,
  and that adversaries will not leverage dynamic invocation or reflection
  to access equivalent functionality.

  Bypasses include string concatenation, variable-based method resolution,
  InvokeMember reflection, and method enumeration via GetMethods().
  Token-level parsing, AST analysis, or behavioral detection of WebClient
  usage would reduce exposure.
