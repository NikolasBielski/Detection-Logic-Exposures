schema_version: 1.0
bypass_description: >
  The detection matches on process.name equal to "aws" to identify AWS CLI usage
  with a custom endpoint URL. By cloning or renaming the AWS CLI binary and executing
  it under a different filename, the attacker preserves identical behavior while
  altering the logged process name, causing the detection to fail.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that process.name is a stable and trustworthy identifier
  for the executed binary and that attackers cannot manipulate it by cloning or
  renaming executables.

  category: process
complexity: Low
notes: >
  This bypass requires no special privileges beyond the ability to execute the AWS
  CLI. Reliance on string-based process identification enables deterministic evasion.
  Using executable path, file hash, or code signature would reduce susceptibility.
