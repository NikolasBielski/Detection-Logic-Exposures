  - ADE4-03  # Logic Manipulation – Incorrect Expression
schema_version: 1.0
bypass_description: >
  The detection logic requires the command line to contain both "curl" and "wget"
  simultaneously. In real-world attack scenarios, adversaries typically use only
  one download utility per command. As a result, legitimate malicious activity
  using either curl or wget alone fails to satisfy the Boolean expression and is
  not detected.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes attackers will invoke multiple download utilities within
  a single command line. It further assumes that requiring the simultaneous
  presence of curl and wget will still capture common post-compromise download
  behavior.

  This is a design-time logic error rather than an attacker-driven evasion. The
  rule is effectively non-functional for realistic attack behavior and results
  in persistent false negatives unless an unlikely command containing both curl
  and wget is executed.
