bypass_description: >
  The detection relies on an exact filename match for "ebpfbackdoor" when
  monitoring file creation events in persistence-related directories. By
  creating persistence files with any alternate filename, the attacker
  achieves identical persistence behavior while avoiding the expected
  filename substring, causing the detection to fail.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that adversaries will retain the original,
  threat-intelligence-derived filename when implementing persistence,
  rather than mutating trivial identifiers such as file names.

notes: >
  This detection reflects a threat-intelligence-specific indicator from 2022
  rather than a robust persistence detection. A more resilient approach would
  monitor file creation activity in /etc/cron.d/ and /etc/sudoers.d/ regardless
  of filename, or correlate suspicious content and permission changes.
