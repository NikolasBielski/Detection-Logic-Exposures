bypass_description: >
  The detection relies on a tightly coupled EQL sequence that assumes specific
  parent process names, short file age, immediate process-to-process timing,
  and the creation of a new Outlook process. An attacker can bypass the rule by
  cloning the parent process binary, waiting out file age checks, delaying COM
  interaction beyond the sequence maxspan, or reusing an existing Outlook COM
  instance so no new OUTLOOK.EXE process is created.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that malicious Outlook COM usage will spawn a new
  OUTLOOK.EXE process within a short, fixed time window, originate from a
  hardcoded set of parent process names or recently created binaries, and that
  COM interactions always result in observable process creation events.

notes: >
  This rule contains multiple independent single points of failure. Outlook is a
  single-instance COM server, allowing aggregation hijacking by reusing an
  existing process. The sequence maxspan can be trivially bypassed with sleep
  delays, and parent process checks are vulnerable to binary cloning. These bugs
  can be stacked to guarantee false negatives with minimal attacker effort.
