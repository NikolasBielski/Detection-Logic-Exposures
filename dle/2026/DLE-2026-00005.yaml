bypass_description: >
  The detection restricts BITS ingress transfer monitoring to a fixed list of
  executable and archive file extensions and a PE header byte check. By
  transferring payloads using alternative archive formats, interpreted script
  types, or macro-enabled documents that do not match the enumerated extensions
  or PE magic bytes, an attacker can leverage BITS to stage malicious content
  without triggering the detection.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that malicious BITS transfers will involve a small,
  static set of executable or archive file extensions or PE-formatted binaries,
  and that excluding other file types does not materially affect detection
  coverage.

  Omitted file types include non-PE archives (7z, gz, bz2, tar), interpreted
  scripts (python, sql), alternate PowerShell module formats (psm1, psd1),
  and macro-enabled Office documents (xlsm, xlsb, docm, pptm).
