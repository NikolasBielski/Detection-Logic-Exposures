bypass_description: >
  The detection uses a New Terms rule keyed only on host.id to identify first-time
  execution of commonly abused remote access tools within a 15-day window. If the
  same RAT has been executed on the host during that period, subsequent executions
  aggregate into the existing baseline and do not alert. An attacker with sufficient
  reconnaissance capability can determine prior RAT usage and intentionally reuse
  the same tool to bypass detection.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes host-level aggregation is sufficiently granular to represent
  first-time malicious RAT execution and that attackers cannot observe or influence
  prior RAT activity within the New Terms history window. It further assumes process
  name matching is a reliable identifier for RAT execution.

notes: >
  This bypass is context-dependent and requires reconnaissance to confirm RAT usage
  within the aggregation window. The rule also contains a secondary ADE3-01 weakness
  due to reliance on process.name.caseless, allowing renamed RAT binaries to evade
  detection regardless of history. Adding user context, executable hash, or
  certificate thumbprint to aggregation would reduce susceptibility.
