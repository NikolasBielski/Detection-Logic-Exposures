bypass_description: >
  The detection uses a chained negation block combining multiple exclusions with
  logical ANDs. Due to De Morgan’s Laws, the negation block evaluates as a single
  inverted gate, meaning that if any one excluded condition is satisfied, the
  entire exclusion evaluates to false. An attacker can exploit this by choosing a
  filename longer than 30 characters, causing the length-based exclusion to trip
  and short-circuit the remaining logic, bypassing the detection entirely.

assumption_violated: >
  The detection assumes that multiple independent NOT conditions combined with
  logical ANDs will each act as separate noise suppressors. It further assumes
  attackers cannot intentionally manipulate a single mutable field to invert the
  Boolean outcome of the entire exclusion chain.

notes: >
  This bypass is deterministic and requires no prior host history or aggregation
  preconditioning. A single long filename is sufficient to invert the exclusion
  gate. The same rule is also independently vulnerable to omitted file types and
  filename-based aggregation hijacking, enabling stacked and orthogonal bypass
  strategies.
